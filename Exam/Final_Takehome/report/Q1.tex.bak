\textbf{Problem definition}:
Write a program for fixed point continuation to generate both the stable and unstable branch of
%
\begin{equation}
	\dot{x} = \mu - x^2
\end{equation}
%
\noindent\hrulefill

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{Solution approach:}
We use sequential continuation for this problem. Each of the stable and unstable branches are tracked by starting from a location on them. It should be noted that due to the turning point at $\mu = 0$ we cannot get both branches using same initial point since we cannot got pass the turning point.

To track the stable branch, we choose our initial guess at $\mu_0 = 0.01$ and $x_0 = 0.1$. The $x$ value is then updated for new value of $\mu_1 = 0.011$ using the following equation.
%
\begin{equation}
	x_1^{k+1} = x_1^{k} + r \Delta x^k
\end{equation}
%
where we set $x_1^0$ equal to $x_0$. $r$ is the relaxation parameter that defines how much we can go in $\Delta x^k$ direction. $\Delta x^k$ is calculated using the following formula.
%
\begin{equation}
	F
